# About the project :
So this a basic project based on money (not real-one ;-) )  transfer from one account to another using react and firebase. I have used the tailwindCSS to do the styling.
In this project when you Sign Up or Sign In a dashboard will open with your details and have a option to transfer money to another user (registered on this webApp). Also shows the last transactions in the transaction history section. 
Firestore is used to store the database, for mail and password authentication and for hosting and deploying the project.
