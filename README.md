# About the project :
So this a basic project based on money (not real-one ;-) )  transfer from one account to another using react and firebase. I have used the tailwindCSS to do the styling. <br> <br>
In this project when you Sign Up or Sign In a dashboard will open with your details and have a option to transfer money to another user (registered on this webApp). Also shows the last transactions in the transaction history section. <br><br>
Firestore is used to store the database, for mail and password authentication and for hosting and deploying the project.
